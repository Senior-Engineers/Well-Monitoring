This Folder contains details about the Production Base Station.

DesignSpark (from RS Components) was used to design the Printed Circuit Board. Please download the three files "Production Base Station (3)", with the extentions "pcb"; "sch" & "prj". Move to a suitable folder and open the Project File which will start DesignSpark and then the Schematic and PCB Layout can be opened. The DesignSpark Software can be downloaded from https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/pcb-software.

The Liquid Crystal Display is mounted on the track side of the PCB and the SIM800L GSM Phone Module and ESP32 Microprocessor are mountind on the component side. By using eight M3 threaded spacers, the PCB is attached to the Liquid Crystal Display and then to the Front Panel.

Light Pipes were used to "guide the light" from the "Network Status" LED on the SIM800L GSM Phone Module and the BUILTIN LED on the ESP32 to show "Data Status" to the Front Panel.

Both the Front and Rear Panels are Perspex to enable the transmission of the radio signals for the Bluetooth and GSM Connections. The GSM Antenna is stuck to the Front Pannel.
